Tool Usage (DM)
====================

Overview
--------
*DM (Diagnostic Monitor)* is a GUI tool for monitoring module statistics (TRX throughput, RSSI, SNR, etc) and controlling NRC7292 modules at LMAC level.

Tool Version
------------
* v2.4

Setup
-----
The program supports two modes:
    1. **Host/Standalone Mode** is used to passively monitor module statistics during host/standalone operation.
    2. **LMAC Test Mode** is used to control and monitor modules at LMAC level. For LMAC test mode, see :ref:`Common RAM Mode Tool Setup Instructions <common_ram_mode_tool_setup>`.

Operation Types 
---------------
The program supports four types of operation:
    1. **TX** (LMAC Test Mode Only):
           Passive monitoring with transmission parameter configuration.
    2. **RX** (LMAC Test Mode Only)
           Passive monitoring with reception parameter configuration.
    3. **MONITOR**
           Passive monitoring without configuration.
    4. **NOISE** (LMAC Test Mode Only)
           
           See :ref:`Channel Noise Estimation Module <noise_level_estimation>`.

In addition, the program features a **REPLAY** functionality, which can be accessed via the menu bar.

Configurable Parameters
-----------------------
    * **COUNTRY** (TX/RX/NOISE):
        is used to select the operating country code.
    * **Channel & BW & MCS** (TX/RX):
        is used to set the operating frequency, bandwidth and MCS index. The MCS parameter does nothing for RX mode and is purely for logging purpose only.
    * **TX Power** (TX):
        is used to set the TX power level.
    * **Packet Length/Interval**:
        is used to configure the packet length and the inter-packet interval.
    * **A-MPDU**:
        is used to toggle A-MPDU usage option.
    * **Rate Control**:
        is used to toggle Rate Control usage option. If toggled on, the MCS index will dynamically change during operation.
    * **Short GI**:
        is used to toggle Short Guard Interval (SGI) usage. If turned off, the guard interval type defaults to Long Guard Interval (LGI).
    * **Ack Type** (TX):
        is used to set the ACK type. Available options are NONE, NDP and NORMAL.
