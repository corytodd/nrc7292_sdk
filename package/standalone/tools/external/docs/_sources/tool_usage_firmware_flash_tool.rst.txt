.. warning::
   Make sure that the correct 2nd bootloader, XIP bootloader and XIP firmware binaries corresponding to the module types (e.g. NRC7292, NRC7393, NRC7394) are selected!

**2nd Bootloader (written on RAM)**:
    is the 2nd bootloader binary file to be temporarily written on RAM to replace the mask ROM bootloader to augment the bootloader functionalities.

**XIP Bootloader (written on flash)**:
    is the XIP bootloader binary file to be stored on the flash memory. The XIP bootloader only needs to be flahsed once.

**XIP Firmware (written on flash)**:
    is the XIP firmware binary file to be stored on the flash memory.

Basic Functionality
-------------------
1. Set the DIP switch (for NRC7292) or jumper configuration (for NRC739X) to **Firmware Download / RAM Operation** mode as described on the instructions panel.
2. Select the desired procedures by using the corresponding check boxes: MAC adresss write, XIP bootloader write, and XIP firmware write.
3. Reset the board, and press the **START** button to run the selected procedures.
