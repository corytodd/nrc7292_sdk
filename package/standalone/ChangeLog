Change summary for version 1.5:

    New features
    * Broadcast FOTA (v1.5)

    Bugfix
    * Duplicated memory free bug when disabling and enabling the network
    * UART2 flow control GPIO setting bugs
    * DHCP server to assign the same IP for the same station
    * CSA failure on the same center frequency channels
    * Beacon loss check for switching to new channel using the same 1MHz primary channel
    * Remove redundant TIM checking
    * Wrong 1MHz primary channel location and primary channel number
    * Fail to receive BU from AP after waking up from deep sleep
    * Heap leakage in updating beacon
    * Multicast frame's sequence number is non sequencial when the duty cycle is on
    * AP sends legacy CTS even when receiving RTS with response indication option of 1 (NDP-Response)

    Changes
    * Update ATCMD
      o Update raspi-atcmd-cli
      o Update AT commands: refer to UG-7292-006-AT_Command document
    * Update SDK
      o Update connection event notification
      o Support to register multiple event handler
      o Update and modified sample applications
      o Add netmask, gateway parameter for softap IP setting
      o Update sample applications
      o Increase max number of scan results
      o Set 1M Primary location according to AP's S1G operation IE
      o Update SDK APIs: refer to UG-7292-005-Standalone SDK API document
    * Update 3rd party libraries
      o Update http_server
    * Power save operation enhancement
      o Enhancement PM1 QoS Null frame transmission process
      o Update TIM mode sleep
      o Update GPIO configuration for deep sleep mode
    * Regulation related updates
      o Update board data for K0/K1/K2 channels
      o K0/K1/K2 channel table
      o Refactoring of LBT

    Known Issues
    * The initial connection time for WPA3-SAE/OWE can be quite lengthy (> 15 seconds)
      due to the substantial computational load required by software for large number operations.
    * The SoftAP disable/enable sequence on the standalone mode is not supported.
    * During an echo test with UART HFC, there is a low probability of a receive data count mismatch in conjunction with delays resulting from RTS deassertion during data transmission.
