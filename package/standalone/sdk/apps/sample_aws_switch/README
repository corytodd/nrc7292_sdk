NRC EVK LED Control with Amazon IoT Cloud
This sample demonstrates how to remotely control LEDs on NRC EVKs (Evaluation Kits) using Amazon IoT Cloud.

Firmware
The sample_aws_switch firmware allows you to control both the red and green LEDs when remote commands are received.

Building the Firmware
For NRC7292
make select target=nrc7292.sdk.release APP_NAME=sample_aws_switch
make

For NRC7394
make select target=nrc7394.sdk.release APP_NAME=sample_aws_switch
make

Running the Firmware
Follow SDK document for help installing and running the firmware

Once the device is paired with the access point (AP), it will connect to the predefined AWS IoT Cloud.
We recommend updating the server URL and SSL credentials as needed.

When the MQTT connection is established with AWS IoT, the firmware will subscribe to the "nrc_switch/control" topic and publish the initial state to the "nrc_switch_status" topic.

You can use the shell scripts provided in the ./host subdirectory to listen to events sent by the device and control the LEDs.

subscribe.sh: Subscribe to the "nrc_switch/status" topic and print messages sent from the device.
switch_control.sh: Control the LEDs on the NRC EVK.

Before running the scripts, ensure that the mosquitto-clients package is installed on your client computer. You can install it on Ubuntu using the following command:
sudo apt install mosquitto-clients

Running the Scripts
To subscribe to events, run:

./subscribe.sh

To control the LEDs, you can use the following commands:
./switch_control.sh red {on/off}
./switch_control.sh green {on/off}
./switch_control.sh red {on/off} green {on/off}
./switch_control.sh on   # Turn both LEDs on
./switch_control.sh off  # Turn both LEDs off

With these scripts, you can remotely control the LEDs on your NRC EVK using the AWS IoT Cloud.
