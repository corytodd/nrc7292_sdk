Appendix (Noise Level Estimation Module)
----------------------------------------
The **Noise Level Estimator** can be used to roughly assess the noise/interference level within the country-code-dependent frequency range.
The height of the histogram bars in the noise estimation mode is determined by an arbitrary measurement unit positively correlated with the noise/interference level in the given channel (taller bars indicate higher noise/interference levels). The noise level estimation feature can be utilzed to serve as a rough visual proxy for the channel quality in the absense of a signal analyzer.
