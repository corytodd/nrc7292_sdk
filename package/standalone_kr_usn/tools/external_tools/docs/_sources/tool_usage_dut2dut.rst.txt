Tool Usage (DUT2DUT)
====================

Overview
--------
*DUT2DUT* is a GUI tool for performing PHY/LMAC-level (sub-IP-network layer level) TRX tests on NRC7292 modules with a logging functionality.

Tool Version
------------
* v2.4

Setup
-----
See :ref:`Common RAM Mode Tool Setup Instructions <common_ram_mode_tool_setup>`.

Operation Types
---------------
    1. **TX**:
           Transmission
    2. **RX**:
           Reception
    3. **NOISE**:
           See :ref:`Channel Noise Estimation Module <noise_level_estimation>`.

Configurable Parameters
-----------------------
    * **COUNTRY** (TX/RX/NOISE):
        is used to select the operating country code.
    * **Channel & BW & MCS** (TX/RX):
        is used to set the operating frequency, bandwidth and MCS index. The MCS parameter does nothing for RX mode and is purely for logging purpose only.
    * **TX Power & RX Gain** (TX/RX):
        is used to set the TX power level and RX gain level (reception sensitivity level with an arbitrary unit). The TX power level does nothing for RX mode and is purely for logging purpose only. Likewise, the RX gain level does nothing for TX mode and is also purely for logging purpose only. It is recommended that the users do not modify the RX gain level. The default RX gain levels are 85 for BW1/2 channels and 80 for BW4 channels.
    * **Guard Interval Type** (TX/RX):
        is used to set the guard interval type. LGI (Long Guard Interval) and SGI (Short Guard Interval) are available. For RX mode, the parameter is for logging purpose only.
    * **Ack Type** (TX/RX):
        is used to set the ACK type. Available options are NONE, NDP and NORMAL. For RX mode, the parameter is for logging purpose only.
    * **TX Operation Parameters**:
        * **FIXED**:
            is used to transmit COUNT OFDM packets are back-to-back with inter-packet spacing of INTERVAL microseconds, with each packet consisting of LENGTH bytes.
        * **CONTINUOUS**:
            is the same as TX-FIXED, except COUNT is infinite.
        * **SINGLE TONE**:
            is used to generate the LO sine signal corresponding to the selected channel frequency. The LO frequency is guaranteed to be the same as the channel frequency only for 2M/4M OFDM signals. For 1M OFDM signals, there may be an offset of either -500, 0, or +500 KHz between the LO frequency and the channel frequency.
        * **DUTY 99%**:
            is used to generate the OFDM waveform with around 99% duty cycle.
    * **RX Operation Parameters**:
        * **FIXED**:
            is used when a fixed number of packets are expected to be recevied. The PER (Packet Error Rate) will be calculated based on this piece of information. See **Reception Timeout Setting** below.
        * **CONTINUOUS**
            is used for continuous reception mode. The operation must be aborted by the user.
    * **Reception Timeout Setting**:
        is optionally used for RX(FIXED) operation. If enabled, the reception procedure will be automatically aborted if there is no incoming signals (both legitimate OFDM signals and interference signals) for the detection period of 5 seconds.
